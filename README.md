# RNN-for-optical-comms

## Machine learning for Advanced High speed communication links

Research internship, guided by Dr. Cleitus Antony Tyndall National Institute, UCC, Ireland. cleitus.antony@tyndall.ie

<l1> implemented various dimensionality reduction algorithms and deep learning models to compress high dimensional photonic data and extract relevant features.</l1>

Achieved 100 percent accuracy on 100 GBPS data feeded with 10 dB noise using LSTM-RNN.
